## About the OpenTechSchool

It is helpful to have a short text about the OpenTechSchool itself at the end of it. This is official short paragraph from the [press-section, where you can find it on other languages, too](http://www.opentechschool.org/press.html)

OpenTechSchool is a community initiative offering free programming workshops and meetups to technology enthusiasts of all genders, backgrounds, and experience levels. It supports volunteer coaches in setting up the events taking care of the organizational details and encouraging them to create original teaching material, to be then openly shared online and further developed with contributions from the global OTS community. OTS’s main goal is to create a friendly learning environment where no one feels shy about asking any question. Everyone is invited to participate, whether as a coach or a learner, and get in contact to organize OTS events anywhere in the world.
